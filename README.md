# Metacrafters_ETH-AVAX_M1
ETH + AVAX Proof: Intermediate Course Module 1 Project

## Description
In this project, I created a smart contract that implements the require(), assert() and revert() statements.

## Functions
### setBalance
This function uses require() function to make sure that entered amount is greater than 5.
### isZero
This function uses assert() to check if the current balance is zero (0).
### withdraw
This function deducts an amount from the balance. It uses revert() if the amount is zero (0).
